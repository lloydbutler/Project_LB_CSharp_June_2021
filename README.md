# Project_LB_CSharp_June_2021
C# project using MySQL DB

Why are we doing this?
To provide the end user with an application where they can enter and filter sales data.

How I expected the challenge to go?
I didn't foresee many issues with the challenge, at first, I felt that I understood all the criteria.

What went well?
I quickly got the structure of the code done and working as expected.

What didn't go as planned?
I had an issue that took some time to notice as I was sending two variables in a different order to what I wanted them in. 
This caused my filtering to work incorrectly, without being obvious as an exception wasn't being thrown.

Possible improvements for the future?
Currently my CLI doesn't clear so I would potentially make that happen for readability.
I would also look at creating a table structure for the output to make it easier to follow.
